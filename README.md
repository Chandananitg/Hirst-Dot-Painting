# Hirst-Dot-Painting

This program is an attempt at mimicking the spot paintings with the colours Hirst,the artist himself used in his paintings.

Damien Hirst (b.1965) is a British contemporary artist. His varied practice explores the complex relationships between art, religion, science, life and death.

   The spot paintings are amongst Hirst’s most widely recognised works. Of the thirteen sub-series within the spots category, the ‘Pharmaceutical’ paintings are the first and most prolific. There are over 1000 in existence, dating from 1986 to 2011.
   Hirst’s “dots” symbolize the presence of an artist’s viewing eye and mind coming to grips with the world via an extended hand and brush, even though, with the “dot” paintings, no such single viewer or thinker has actually extended his hand to make them.
